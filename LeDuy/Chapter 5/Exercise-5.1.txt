1. Suppose that coverage criterion C1 subsumes coverage criterion C2. Further suppose that
test set T1 satisfies C1 on program P and test set T2 satisfies C2, also on P.
(a) Does T1 necessarily satisfy C2? Explain.
Solution:
Yes. This follows directly from the definition of subsumption.
(b) Does T2 necessarily satisfy C1? Explain.
Solution:
No. There is no reason to expect test requirements generated by C1 to be satisfied by
T2.
