Suppose that coverage criterion C1 subsumes coverage criterion 
C2. Further suppose that test set T1 satisfies C1 on program P 
and test set T2 satisfies C2, also on P.

(a) Does T1 necessarily satisfy C2? Explain.

(b) Does T2 necessarily satisfy C1? Explain.

(c) If P contains a fault, and T2 reveals the fault, T1 does not
necessarily also reveal the fault. Explain.


Answer:
A:Yes T1 necessarily satisfy C2 as This follows directly from 
the definition of subsumption.

B:No T2 doesnt necessarily satisfy C1 as There is no reason to 
expect test requirements generated by C1 to be satisfied by T2.


C:No testers think that test sets for strong criteria are as 
good at finding faults as test sets for weaker criteria. there 
is no requirement that T2 will be an subset of T1. So, it 
is possiable that T2 may contain one test that reveals the fault
, and T1 doesn't reveal any fault.
