 Chapter 3 contained the program Calc.java. It is available on the
program listings page on the book website.
Calc currently implements one function: it adds two integers. Use
test-driven design to add additional functionality to subtract two
integers, multiply two integers, and divide two integers. First 
create a failing test for one of the new functionalities, modify 
the class until the test passes, then perform any refactoring 
needed. Repeat until all of the required functionality has been 
added to your new version of Calc, and all tests pass.
Remember that in TDD, the tests determine the requirements. This
means you must encode decisions such as whether the division
method returns an integer or a floating point number in automated
tests before modifying the software.Submit printouts of all tests, your final version of Calc, and a
screenshot showing that all tests pass. Most importantly, include 
a narrative describing each TDD test created, the changes needed to
make it pass, and any refactoring that was necessary.


Answer:
For the first version check the Calc1Test.java and Calc1.java.
The final version is Calc.java and CalcTest.java
