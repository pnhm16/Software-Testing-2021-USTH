Develop JUnit tests for the BoundedQueue class. A compilable
version is available on the book website in the file
BoundedQueue.java. Make sure your tests check every method,
but we will not evaluate the quality of your test designs and do not
expect you to satisfy any test criteria. Turn in a printout of your
JUnit tests and either a printout or a screen shot showing the 
results of each test.


Answer:
Check the BoundedQueue.java and the BoundedQueueTest.java
