Replace each occurrence of a set with a list in the JUnit theory 
removeThenAddDoesNotChangeSet. Is the resulting theory valid or 
invalid? How many of the tests that pass the precondition also 
pass the postcondition? Explain

Answer
The resulting theory is definitely not valid because order 
matters in lists. Hence the JUnit theory fails.
