Topic: Give a one-to-two paragraph explanation for how the inheritance hierarchy can affect controllability
and observability.

Answer: inheritance hierarchy affects controllability as we will need to control every superclass and its subclasses,
and if we have a deep inheritance tree, it will be very complicated. On the other hand it affects the observability,
we need to observe a large number of subclasses that are actually doing the same job as the super class.
