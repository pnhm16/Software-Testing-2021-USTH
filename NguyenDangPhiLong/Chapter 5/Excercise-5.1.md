# Chapter 5: 
## a) Does T1 necessarily satisfy C2?
* Yes, T1 satisfies C1 and C1 subsumes C2 
## b) Does T2 necessarily satisfy C1?
* No. There is no reason to expect test requirements generated by C1 to be satisfied by T2
since C2 is smaller than C1 
## c) If P contains a fault, and T2 reveals the fault, T1 does not necessarily also reveal the fault.
*  No. Subsumption is about criteria, not about test sets.There is no requirement that test set T2 
be a subset of test set T1. So, it could happen that T2 contains that one test that reveals the 
fault, and T1 doesn't
