Exercise 7.2.3-1: 
    (a)
        Below are four graphs, each of which is defined by the sets of nodes, initial nodes, final nodes, edges, and defs and uses. 
        Each graph also contains some test paths. Answer the following questions about each graph 
    (b) 
        x has 5 du-paths, as enumerated below: i [1, 2, 8] ii [1, 2, 3, 5, 6] iii [4, 3, 5, 6] iv [4, 3, 5, 7, 2, 8] v [4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 2, 8] 
    (c) 
        The numbers in the table below correspond to the du-paths in the previous table. The table indicates whether each test path tours each du-path with or without a sidetrip. direct sidetrip t1 i t2 i t3 ii i t4 iv t5 iii, v t6 iii, iv, v (d) There are several alternative answers to this question. To directly tour a path that fulfills all-defs for the def at node 0, use either t1 or t3, and to directly tour a path that fulfills all-defs for the def at node 3, use either t4 or t5. t1, t4 or t1, t5 or t3, t4 or t3, t5 are examples of possible replies. 
    (e) 
        There is just one viable response to this question: t1, t3, and t5 
    (f) 
        There is just one viable response to this question: t1, t3, t4, and t5
