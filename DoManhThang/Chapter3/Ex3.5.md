#### 3.5: Find the flaw of a given testSort() method, and describe it using the RIPR model.

test shows limited access because test only checks the first element in the list. check will skip some errors if the elements are from the second on if it is not sorted. Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria set forth by the RIPR model. it just satisfies the infection where the incorrect state can occur.
