*__Question:__ Suppose that coverage criterion C1 subsumes coverage criterion C2. Further suppose that test set T1 satisfies C1 on program P and test set T2 satisfies C2, also on P.*

*a. Does T1 necessarily satisfy C2? Explain.*
-Yes, it does. The above statement is basically the definition of subsumption.

*b. Does T2 necessarily satisfy C1? Explain.*
-No, it does not. There is no reason for T2 to satisfy test
requirement generated by C1 at all.

*c. If P contains a fault, and T2 reveals the fault, T1 does not necessarily also reveal the fault. Explain.*
-Subsumption, after all, is about criteria, not about test sets. T2 is not necessarily a subset of T1. Therefore, if a test set in T2 reveals the fault, but that test set is not in T1, then T1 will not reveal the fault.
